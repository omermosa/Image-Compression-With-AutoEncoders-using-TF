# Image-Compression-With-AutoEncoders-using-TF
This repo implements a Deep Convolutional Autoencoder using Tf.Keras for the purpose of learning to compress the input image to half its size. It was trained on the Flowers Dataset with an input size of 128 * 128 * 3. The model contains about 3M parameters, and the trained keras model is attached. For more info, check the notebook.
